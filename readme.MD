# TaskMaster

## A simple to-do list manager for Android

Allows the user to manage tasks on a single mobile device.

This was developed as an entry requirement for the [Codepath Android Mobile Bootcamp](https://codepath.com/androidbootcamp).

### Prerequisities

You can build the app and sideload it onto any Android device or Android emulator running 4.0.3 or later.

### Installing

After cloning the repository, build and install using [this guideline](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html)

## Using

From the main screen, use the fab (floating action button) to add new tasks. You can edit a task by clicking on it, and even add new tasks while editing by using the fab. When editing, return to the main screen by using the back button. Make sure you use the save button first. From the main screen you can mark a task as done, and you can delete tasks by swiping them off the screen.

On larger wide devices the selected task's edit screen appears on the same page, alongside the task list.
